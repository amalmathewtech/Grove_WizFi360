## WizFi360 Arduino Library

WIZnet has provided an [**Arduino library**][link-Arduino library and examples for WizFi360] to communicate with the WizFi360 module anda few example sketches that implement basic Wi-Fi applications. 
You can install the WizFi360 library by downloading it as a ZIP file and adding it to your Arduino libraries folder.



This document will guide through a series of steps from configuring development environment to running Arduino
library and examples using the WIZnet's Wi-Fi product - [**WizFi360**][link-wizfi360].

## Development environment configuration

To test the WizFi360 Arduino library & examples, the development environment must be configured to use Arduino platform.

Please note that in this guide examples were configured and tested using **Arduino IDE** in **Windows** environment.

Before starting, download and install the Arduino IDE from the link below.

- [Arduino IDE][link-arduino_ide]

####  How to install an Arduino library
* Download from github 
  
  
  Open [**WizFi360 Arduino Library Github page**][link-Arduino library and examples for WizFi360], then you can click on the Clone or download >Download ZIP button to get the library package.

* Add the library
  Add ZIP Library  - Since you have downloaded the zip Library, open your Arduino IDE, click on Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library.

* Check
Then let's check if the library install correctly.

When you add a library successfully, there will be a demo in the Example. In this case, click on File > Example > WizFi360 > ScanNetworks to open an example, click on the Verify button, if there's no error, congratulation, the library is installed perfectly.

### Example testing
This section will guide through testing with ScanNetworks example as an example using Grove_WizFi360 & Arduino Mega 2560

* Connect Arduino Mega 2560 to desktop or laptop using USB type B cable.

* Select the type of Arduino board that you are using by the path: Here we will be using Arduino Mega 2560
 
    Tools --> Board -->Arduino AVR Boards -->Arduino Mega or Arduino 2560

* Upload the ScanNetworks example code
    When there appears "Done uploading", congratulate you upload successfully.
Below is a screenshot of the ScanNetworks example showing the list of detected networks.
